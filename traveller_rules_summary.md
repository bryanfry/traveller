# Traveller Rules Summary!

Maybe this will help the first session run more smoothly.  Also I barely know the rules, so maybe writing the doc will help me learn them.  DOH!

Most of what is here are official rules.  There are some house rules too.


## Dice
Traveller is a d6 system, so everything is resolved with rolls of or more d6.  No d20, etc.

## DnD features that are NOT in Traveller

* **No Character Classes.** There are no classes in Traveller!  Characters are defined by characteristic scores and skills.  There is an idea of ‘careers’ which is what your dude did before becoming an adventurer (asteroid belt miner, commodore in the Imperial Navy, etc.) and the rules for this stuff are very cool, but its not so important until we roll up new characters.

* **No Character Levels** There are no overall levels, just levels in individual skills (more below).  There is also no concept of experience points!  Skills can advance slowly under special circumstances, but advancement is mostly driven by the story and by gear, ships, and social importance.

* **No Hit Points and Armor Class**. Damage and armor work differently.  Armor soaks damage, instead of making you harder to hit, so no armor class.  Damage is subtracted directly from your physical characterisitc scores, so no hit points. This means you become less capable as you are get injured.


## Races
**[HOUSE RULE!]** For now, human. There are alien races in Traveller, but I think they are mostly lame.  The one non-lame I think I want to save for NPCs.  Maybe later we will adapt the excellent Star Frontiers races... 

* Dralasite (amoeba-blob people)
* Yazirian (monkeys with pseudo-wings like flying squirrel)
* Vrusk (vaguely Japanese bug-people).

## Characteristic Scores
There are 6 scores that are similar but not identical to the DnD Characteristic scores.  They usually range from 2-12.

* Strength (STR)
* Dexterity (DEX)
* Endurance (END) – mostly like DnD Constitution
* Intelligence (INT) – This covers lots of things, and is sort of a mix of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma in DnD.
* Education (EDU) – Book-learnin’  (not natural smarts).
* Social Standing (SOC) – Value of 2 might be a dirty backworld peasant, and 12 could be an admiral, celebrity, or minor noble.

### Raw Characteristic Score checks
**[HOUSE RULE]**. If you need to make a check to succeed for something based purely on your characteristic score, **without a skill**, you roll 2d6, apply a difficulty modifier, and succeed if you roll EQUAL to or LESS THAN the characteristic score.  

**EXAMPLE**  Endurance check to resist passing out from a stun-gun.  (This is uncommon, skill checks happen more often).

Characteristic score modifiers to **skill checks** (skills explained in next section...)

* Score 2: 	-2
* Score 4-6: 	-1
* Score 6-8:	 0
* Score 9-11	+1
* Score 12	+2

## Skills
Like DnD, Traveller has skills... the basic idea is similar. Here are examples of some skills (there are alot).
* Science
* Gun Combat
* Melee Combat
* Computers
* Medic
* Engineer - operating and reparing systems on a spaceship
* Mechanic - repairing other things
* Drive - driving non-spaceship vehicles (hovercraft, motorcycles, Dune-style ornithopters)
* Carouse (social skills in the context of party)
* Admin (social skills dealing with bureaucratic BS or legal issues)
* Streetwise (social skills dealing with criminals / shady people)

Some skills have **subskills / specializations** as well.  For example, **Gun Combat** includes several subskills :

* Energy (lasers, small plasma guns, stunners)
* Slug (projectile guns)
* Archaic (bow-and-arrow, blowgun, etc)

If you know nothing about a skill, you are ‘unskilled’.  Better than ‘unskilled’ is level 0, then 1, 2, etc.  (I think the max may be 4).  For skills with subskills, level 0 covers all the subskills, and then you could have levels in individual subskills beyond that.

**EXAMPLE**

* Somebody who knows nothing about guns is ‘unskilled’ in Gun Combat.
* Somebody with basic familiarity has level 0 in Gun Combat, and this applies to every kind of gun.
* A soldier might have Skill 2 in Slug (and will also have skill 0 for other guns).


### Skill Checks

Traveller skill checks are mostly similar to DnD.  You roll 2d6, add your level in the relevant skill, add your Characteristic modifier in the appropriate Characteristic score, and succeed if the total is equal to or greater than a value that depends of difficulty (often 8, but could be higher or lower for harder/easier task).  

* Attack rolls in combat are actually skill checks.  

* The **Effect** of the skill check is the difference between the threshold and your roll (it measures how well you succeed or how miserably you fail).

* **EXAMPLE**:  You have Slug skill of 2 and Dexterity of 10 (+1 adjustment).  To shoot somebody with an assault rifle you roll 2d6 and add 3 (+2 for skill, +1 for DEX).  If the sum is 8 or greater, you hit.  
	*  In this case, say you roll a natural 9.  After the Dexterity and Gun Combat bonuses, that is a 12.  You need at least 8 to hit, and you exceeded this by 4, so the **Effect** is 4.  (More on Effect in combat specifically below...)

	* To shoot somebody with a laser pistol, your Gun Combat skill would be 0 (its A gun but not a Slug weapon), so you only at the +1 for DEX.

* **If you are UNSKILLED (don’t have even level 0 in the skill), you get a penality of -3!  This is a big penalty… skill Level 0 is much better than being unskilled.**

In DnD, each skill is always associated with a specific ability score.  For example, Persuasion in DnD is always associated with Charisma.  In Traveller, the Characteristic score you use for skill check depends on the situation.  

* **EXAMPLE** If you want to use the **Carouse** skill to poke around for clues at a decadent super-wealthy orgy where everybody has holographic masks, you might use **Social Standing** for the Characteristic adjustement.  But to use **Carouse** skill to drink someone under the table, you would use **Endurance**.  
* **EXAMPLE** With Gun Combat, you use Dexterity to shoot someone but could use Education + Gun Combat to identify the manufacturer of an off-world firearm.

**Boon & Bane** – Boon and Bane is similar to Advantage or Disadvantage for an attack / skill check in DnD.  If you have a Boon, you roll 3d6 for skill check and take the highest 2 rolls.  If you have a Bane, you roll 3d6 and take the lowest 2 rolls.


##Combat

### Attack Roll
The attack roll is a skill check for the appropriate combat skill / subskill (Gun Combat, Melee Combat, Heavy Weapons).  Usually its DC 8 to hit, with extra adjustments for range, etc.

### Damage
When you hit someone if combat, you roll damage dice that depend on the weapon.  Then you add the Effect of the attack skill check (the amount by which you exceeded the to-hit threshold, usually 8).  Then you SUBTRACT their armor value (more on that below). 

Damage is first subtracted from Endurance.  If Endurance reaches 0, damage is subtracted from either DEX or STR.  If 2 Characteristic scores (including END) reach 0, target is unconscious.  If all 3 score reach 0, you die.

### Automatic weapons
Some weapons have an 'auto' trait, and say something like Auto 3.  These have three modes

* Single shot - works normally.  Uses one ammo.
* Burst -- add the Auto score to damage on a hit.  Uses ammo = Auto score.
* Full Auto -- Make # attacks = the Auto score.  Uses ammo = (Auto score x 3).

### Armor
Armor soaks damage... it usually does not make you harder to hit. If you have armor with rating of 5, every attack subtracts 5 from its damage.  An attack doing 5 or fewer damage points has no effect.  But some weapons have an ‘Armor Piercing’ property (AP).  That allows them to ignore that many points of armor.  So if you have 5 armor points and are hit with an AP-3 weapon, the armor will only reduce damage by 2.

Combat – other stuff.
This page has good description of the other combat rules (initiative, types of action, etc) :

##Political Environment 

**[Slightly Houseruled]** There is a big, powerful Imperium (mostly human) that covers at least hundreds of systems.  It has similarities to the empire in Dune, Foundation, and Star Wars There are also other large empires of other races.  The Imperium is in decay, so things are unruly around the edges, where the fun stuff happens (the interior is still quite civilized and mostly boring).  There are noble houses in the Imperium, and the nobles are able to exert alot more personal power far from the center of the empire.  Some worlds are democratic, but its pretty rare.

##Star Systems
Some star systems have one or more inhabited planets, moons, or asteroids, and other don't.  **Garden Worlds** are planets (or moons) with an Earthlike environment and temperature range, and they are rare.  Most worlds are pretty crappy in one way or another (too hot, too cold, poisonous or non-existant atmosphere, high gravity, etc). Like Battlestar Galactica, humans have lost track of their original homeworld.

##Starship tech

(There are alot of rules for ships, but I'm not planning using them much to start.  This part is mostly fluff for now...)

* Starships travel between systems using something called a **Jump Drive**.  It runs on hydrogen fusion, and some ships have "fuel scoops" that let them slurp up fuel from the atmosphere of gas giant planets (like Jupter, etc).  A ship usually only has enough fuel for one jump.  During jump, the ship is outside the regular universe and USUALLY cannot be directly tracked or attacked.  A jump of any intersteller distance takes about one week.  

	* Miscalculating a jump is very bad, since there is rarely enough fuel to jump again.  Best case is many years of sub-light travel to the closest system.  Jump calculation is covered by the **Astrogation** skill. 

	* The DISTANCE a ship can travel in a jump depends on the technology level of its jump drive (ranges from 1 to 6 parsecs).  This is an interesting mechanic that makes star systems without a close neighbor have much less trade and outside interaction, because only rare hi-tech ships can get there.

* Most ships also have something called a **Maneuver Drive** for shorter-distance travel, fighting, etc.  It is something like an impulse drive from Star Trek, and usually won't run out of fuel.  Only very low-tech ships use rocket engines.  

* Most ships have artificial gravity.  

##Technology Level (TL)
Worlds have a **Technology Level** ranging from 1 (pre-medieval) to 15 (super high-tech).  This strongly impacts what sorts of things are available there.  It is common for a low-tech world to still have a dingy starport and support a bit intersteller trade even if there is no tech to actually build ships there.  Also, a higher-tech elite may rule the low-tech plebs on a low-tech world.

* Current earth-like tech is Tech Level 8.
* Jump drive, maneuver drive, artificial gravity, and fusion power all become available at TL9.  (This seems weird to me and I might change it).

##Computers 
**[Sort of houseruled, mostly me rambling]** There are rules for computers in Traveller, and I may change them.  One thing I want to do is limit the Characteristic of regular digital computers (and storage) to be at or less than present-day power.  My excuse is that for some reason the laws of physics don't allow small transitors to work reliably.  So no fancy machine learning, and no searchable digital encyclopdia.  This makes actual human expertise more valuable, and means that people still use books, microfiche, and analog radios.  It could mean something like Dune where some people use specialized training or drugs to mimic computers. There will still some high-tech computing devices (like cybernetic implants, which are in the rules and are very cool) but they only work with quantum computing or some other weird-ass tech.
